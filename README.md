### Group Proposal

a.  Job board text analysis. Can we predict salary from job description?
    Predictive. Regression/Classification depending on whether we decide
    to coarsen the salary into bins. Use Kaggle or Indeed dataset with
    job\_description text.

  Kaggle - response variable mined from the job description (they're
  strings and come in several formats--hourly, annual, etc.). Indeed -
  restricts to the Data Scientist/Machine Learning job sub-field. The
  response variable is "queried salary" and precategorized.

b.  Yelp text analysis. Can we predict the stars a reviewer gives from
    the sentiments expressed in the text review itself? Predictive.
    Classification. Kaggle Yelp dataset:
    <https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset>.

c.  Speech analysis. Grab YouTube audio of news footage, horror clips,
    comedy, etc. use Praat software to extract features of the audio
    recording such as pitch, volume, etc., then predict which genre the
    audio comes from. Prediction. Classification.
