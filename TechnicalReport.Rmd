### Abstract
A brief overview of the area that youâ€™ll be investigating, the research question(s) of interest, your approach to analysis, and the general conclusions.

The Yelp dataset includes over 5 million text reviews from businesses around the world. We aim to predict the number of stars a reviewer gives a business from the text of the review itself. To do so, we take two approaches: connecting review words to sentiment dictionaries and learning from the data itself. Because the nature of our response variable is ordered, we also think about how the fit of our model should be judged using a handful of different error measurements.

To glean meaning from the words a reviewer uses, we turned first to the NRC sentiment dictionary. This is a basket of over 14,000 words manually coded into 9 sentiments based on surveys from human reviewers. In this way, each word on its own (devoid of surrounding context) has a meaning determined a priori by the categories the sample of reviewers chose. We also assign rankings based upon the Afinn dictionary for every pair of words, or bigram, within a review. Afinn uses a numeric scale so that we can easily flip the score of any negated word pair such as "not good."  Our misclassification rates (MCR) ranged between 0.473 and 0.535, attributed in part to high correct classification rates for 1 and 5 star reviews but abysmal correct classifications for 2 and 3 star reviews. Tree-based methods tended to perform best, but all methods performed worse in the 2-3 star case.        


### Introduction
Overview of the setting of the data, existing theories/models (particularly if you are working in a descriptive/inferential setting), and your research questions.

Our task is prediction-based. After reading a review, it's easy for humans to place it into the proper rating. We examine each individual word's meaning, look for dependencies between words, discern the strength of a sentiment based upon context clues, correct misspellings automatically, note sarcasm, among others. Can statistical learning models learn to process language used in Yelp reviews? Our predictors from the text were mainly single word and bigram phrases, and the analysis below became an exercise in natural language processing.

### The Data
Where does the data come from? How many observations? How many variables? What does each observation refer to (what is the observational unit)? What sorts of data processing was necessary to get the data in shape for analysis?

We turn to the extensive [Yelp Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/version/6#yelp_review.csv), which contains 5,200,000 reviews and the 7 variables below: 

- `text`: contains the text of the review as a string

- `business_id`: identifier for the business being reviewed, character

- `review_id`: unique identifier for each review (observations are uniquely identified by this), character

- `user_id`: identifier for each user submitting a review, character

- `cool`: number of people who found the review "cool", numeric

- `funny`: number of people who found the review "funny", numeric

- `useful`: number of people who found the review "useful", numeric

Though there are interesting extenstions in the the other variables given in the raw data set, all predictors for this analysis come from transformations to the raw `text` variable.

The Yelp data set's size gives plenty of test data to work with, so we create four different data sets to fit (training) then assess (test) our model. So generally, we need not use cross validation to estimate our models' test errors.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
**Explore the structure of the data through graphics. Here you can utilize both traditional plots as well as methods from unsupervised learning. Understanding the distribution of your response is particular important, but also investigate bivariate and higher-order relationships that you expect to be particular interesting.

The bulk of our data exploration comes at our choices of features to extract and the methodology by which to extract those features. 

#### Sentiment dictionaries

Cleaning process:

1) Drop all stop words from the review such as "the", "in", "to", "a", etc.

  - Count # non-stop words
  
2) Remove all non-English reviews using the `textcat` package.

3) Tokenize the words (used `stringr` library to split by space, and `grepl()` function to remove unnessessary punctuation, etc). so that we are left with only meaningful words,

4) Join words from the sentiment categories in NRC and count number of words in each review by sentiment that are categorized into a sentiment.

See link to accompanying RMarkdown of all code used to clean and produce the features.


This resulted a dataset with the dimensions listed above. 
```{R}
x <- train_senti %>% select(-c(X.1, X, X1))
glimpse(x)
```
- `nwords`: number of words in a given review

- `punct`: number of punctuation marks except apostrophes

- `score`: average sentiment for all adjacent two-word pairs or bigrams within a given review negations were negated by their second word. (i.e. if "good" = 2 then "not good" = -2)

- `sentences`: number of sentences within a given review

- `exclaim`: number of exclamation marks within a given review

- `joy`: number words categorized as "joy" within the NRC lexicon

- `disgust`: 

- `anger`: 

- `fear`: 

- `positive`: 

- `trust`: 

- `negative`: 

- `anticipation`: 


```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1}Distribution of the Response"}
ggplot(train_senti, aes(starsfactor)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + 
  ggtitle("Bar Graph of Stars")
nrow(train_senti %>% filter(stars == 2 | stars == 3)) / nrow(train_senti)
```

Figure \ref{fig:fig1} shows that our sample is left skewed. The bulk of the reviews are clustered at 5, 4, then 1. Two and three-star reviews jointly comprise only 19.7% of all reviews. Therefore, we might expect classification models to do worse overall at predicting these categories. 2-3 star "middle-of-road" reviews may lack strong sentiment words at either end of the spectrum, so we hypothesize that our sentiment libraries may have trouble predicting lukewarm reviews.   

```{r}
# Disgust
disgust <- ggplot(train_senti, aes(starsfactor, disgustratio)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of disgust words")

# Negativity
negativ <- ggplot(train_senti, aes(stars, negativeratio)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of negative words")

grid.arrange(disgust, negativ)
```

The graphs above may appear counterintuitive. But more 5-star reviews overall meant more chances in which the negativeratio could rocket up. The table of summary statistics reveals that postive leaning sentiments (joy, positive, etc.) were not necessarily increasing in stars. So we think the `score` variable may dampen the effect of negated positive or joyful words in lower scoring reviews. 

![Summary statistics across 5 predictors](images/summary stats table.png)

```{r}
t.score <- train_senti %>%
  group_by(stars) %>%
  summarise(means = mean(score, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull(means)

t.joyratio <- train_senti %>%
  group_by(stars) %>%
  summarise(means = mean(joyratio, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull(means)

t.joy <- train_senti %>%
  group_by(stars) %>%
  summarise(means = mean(joy, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull(means)

t.positive <- train_senti %>%
  group_by(stars) %>%
  summarise(means = mean(positive, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull(means)

t.disgust <- train_senti %>%
  group_by(stars) %>%
  summarise(means = mean(disgust, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull(means)

t.negative <- train_senti %>%
  group_by(desc(stars)) %>%
  summarise(means = mean(negative, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pull(means)

library(kableExtra)

table <- rbind(t.negative, t.disgust, t.positive, t.joy, t.score)
colnames(table) <- c(1:5)
table <- t(table)
rownames(table) <- c(1:5)
```

```{r fig2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig2}Scatter of Stars"}
ggplot(train_senti, aes(x=positive, y = disgust)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(color = stars)) + 
  ggtitle("Scatter of Stars") 
```

In Figure \ref{fig:fig2} we can see that positively identified words are correlated with higher levels of stars, whereas the cluster of dark blue indicates that the presence of more disgust words in proportion to the total number of words is correlated with lower stars. 

In the figure below, the number of stars appears to be decreasing in the number of words in general. This could be because people at the lower end of the star spectrum might have more to say, or describe specific instances or stories in which their expectations were not met(??lol wait does this make sense). 
```{r fig3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig3}Scatterplot of number of words in a review vs. stars"}
ggplot(data = train_senti, aes(x = nwords, y = stars)) + 
  geom_jitter(size = 0.25) + 
  geom_smooth() #stars
```

### Modeling
Construct (descriptive and/or predictive) (classification and/or regression) models that address your research questions. You are encouraged to fit many different classes of models and see how they compare in terms the bias/variance tradeoff (do you have a Rashomon effect going on?). Also be sure to guard against overfitting through cross-validation or shrinkage/penalization (donâ€™t forget about ridge regression and the lasso).

This will be the most extensive section and will include your results as well.

To answer one of our initial questions, proper treatment of ordered classes, we fit a series of classification and regression models. 

```{r}


```

RANDOM FOREST v. BAGGED MODELS:

Benefits - can overcome the problem of variance that arises from bagged trees by forcing each decision tree split to consider only a subset of the total predictors. Small $m$ is helpful given a large number of correlated predictors, such as our bag of words data set (ISLR). This is true for our data as well--smaller $m$, given by the blue and purple lines, outperforms larger $m$. We expect the difference between $m = p$ and $m = \sqrt{p}$ to be more prevalent using the bag of words data. 

```{r}
# Code below ensures that we don't have any missingness or non-numeric predictors
# in the dfs used to fit the model
cols <- colnames(train_senti)
drop <- grepl("ratio|X|id|funny|cool|useful", cols)
cols.counts <- setdiff(cols, cols[drop])

sentiments <- c("anger", "fear", "surprise", "trust", "disgust", "negative", "positive", "joy")

df <- train_senti %>% 
  select(score, stars, cols.counts) %>%
  select(-c(text, date, starsfactor, language))

df.test <- test_senti %>% 
  select(score, stars, cols.counts) %>%
  select(-c(text, date, starsfactor, language))

row.has.na <- apply(df, 1, function(x){any(is.na(x))})
df <- df[!row.has.na, ]

row.has.na <- apply(df.test, 1, function(x){any(is.na(x))})
df.test <- df.test[!row.has.na, ]

y.test <- df.test %>%
  pull(stars)
x.test <- df.test %>%
  select(-c(stars))
```

### Fitting Random Forest and Bagged Models

#### Sentiment Dictionary: 
```{r}
set.seed(120)
# select only some of the observations for run time concerns
n <- 1000
# Tree-based methods ~ Regression
rf <- randomForest(data = df[1:n,], 
                   type = "regression",
                   stars~., 
                   xtest = x.test,
                   ytest = y.test,
                   ntree = 100, 
                   mtry = ncol(df) / 3)

# specify x.test and y.test arguments to calculate a test error
bagged <- randomForest(data = df[1:n,], 
                       type = "regression",
                       stars~., 
                       xtest = x.test,
                       ytest = y.test,
                       ntree = 100, 
                       mtry = ncol(df))


mse.df <- data.frame(rfs = rf$mse, 
                     bagged = bagged$mse,
                     rfs_test = rf$test$mse,
                     bagged_test = bagged$test$mse)
                     

forest.mses <- ggplot(data = mse.df, aes(x = c(1:100))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = bagged, color = "Bagged OOB MSES")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = rfs, color = "Random Forest OOB MSES")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = rfs_test, color = "Random Forest test MSES")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = bagged_test, color = "Bagged test MSES")) + 
  labs(title = "Error across bagged and random forest regression models") +
  xlab("Number of trees") +
  ylab("Error")
  
forest.mses

```
As we can see the random forest model appears to perform best overall, as its test and OOB MSEs were lowest consistently. Although the model performs better at slightly under 50 trees, it performs best on test data with 100 trees, so we kept the 100-tree model. 

From the figure above, it is clear that when the bag of words data rf and bagged models underperformed with the test set. However, is extracting estimating with the top 500 training words on an entirely new test data set tractable? Because the predictors were learned from the data itself, the reason the predictors may be less useful when applied to the test set. We might also think that using 500 predictors risked overfitting the model(??). The table below shows the variable importances of each of the words in the bag of words data set.





```{r}
importance.bag <- as.data.frame(rf.bag$importance)
importance.bag$predictor <- rownames(rf.bag$importance)
importance.bag %<>%
  arrange(desc(IncNodePurity)) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

  ii.Type 2 error rate for each class (from columns of confusion matrix)

4. Test Misclassification rate
